# Driver's Drowsiness Detection

I developed a driver drowsiness detection system using Python, OpenCV, and eye tracking techniques. This project aimed to enhance
road safety by monitoring driver alertness in real-time. Using computer vision and machine learning algorithms, the system detects
signs of drowsiness by analyzing eye movements and alerts the driver accordingly, potentially preventing accidents caused by driver
fatigue.
